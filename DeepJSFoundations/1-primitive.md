// In Javascript everything is an Object

/*

Nope

undefined
string
number
boolean
object

symbol (Added ES6)
Funkyish behaviour

undeclared? Not exactly a type, but has behaviour
null
function? - Kind of like a sub type of object.
sometimes referred to as a callable object

array? - subtype of object. With numerical indexing, and getter length etc.

bigint (not here yet lol)


you can check the typeof a variable using the function typeof

typeof will always return a string. Which is important, often you see people doing incorrect tests like

typeof(x) !== undefined when it hould be typeof(x) != "undefined"

Null is still weird

v = null
typeof(v) // "object"
This is pretty much a bug in the CORE

Undefined versus undeclared
